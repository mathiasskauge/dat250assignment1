When trying to implement the REST API I didn't quite manage to make it work. I understood to some extent how and where to code the CRUD functions, and also added a dependency for JpaRepository api("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa:3.1.0"), to use Spring Data JPAs functions. But when I run the application I get a Failed to configure a DataSource - error.
