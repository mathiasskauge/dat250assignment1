When using the RabbitMQ it hadnt automatically been added to the PATH so I had to do that manually.

When adding the jar files to my project they werent detected automatically, so had to add them as libraries manually

I managed to run the classes in Intellij, but I didnt manage to compile them i separate shell, due to a classpath issue I think. Will ask someone for help about this.
