# Technical Problems with JPA Installation and Resolution.

I didn't experience any major issues with the installation.

# Inspecting the database tables

For inspecting the databases I've tried to establish a connection with mySQL workbench but havnt quite figured it out so far. I tried changing the persistence.xml file to have the database connect to the workbench and also added a "MySQL JDBC driver" to the classpath. I didn't manage to establish a connection with it yet.


Questions:

The database H2 is an embedded database. It means that the database engine runs within the Java application, and it is not a separate server like MySQL. 
It starts when the application starts and saves data in a file named "DB" in the project's root directory. 

Yes, I just change the value of hibernate.format_sql to "true" to get the sql
Hibernate: 
    create table Customer (
        id bigint generated by default as identity,
        name varchar(255),
        primary key (id)
    )






I have also ensured that the included test case passes successfully.
Inspection of Database Tables

To inspect the database tables created by JPA, I used the following steps:

    Database Access: I used a database client tool to access the database. In my case, I used MySQL Workbench.

    Viewing Tables: In the database client, I connected to the database specified in my JPA configuration. I then navigated to the schema and viewed the tables created by JPA.



    technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) and how you resolved

    a link to your code for experiment 2 above. Make sure the included test case passes!

    an explanation of how you inspected the database tables and what tables were created. For the latter, you may provide screenshots.
