### Problems I encountered 

I had a lot of problems trying to get this to work, trying both with and without using a service.
I first had one component for each REST command, but I figured this wasnt needed. I also had only one component for all of them, but in the end just edited
the already existing app.components that were initially created. The problem solved it self when I double checked what the actual localhost adress was, which I suspect was 
wrong all along.

I also have question:

I looked at alot of different toturials to solve the problem, and I saw that alot of the REST apis used a repository and not only a controller, when is this needed?
